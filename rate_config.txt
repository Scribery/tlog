These are the lines of information in the configuration files. This information should also be in the man page for recording.
If this is too long for the configuration files, use all of the comments in the man page and only keep the purpose and information
about parameters in the configuration files.

    // Rate-limiting collection if desired, prevents output that occurs
    // at a rate larger than the one provided to from being added to the log.
    // If the provided rate is 0, then the rate-limiting is disabled.
    // If the provided number is greater than 0, then that is used
    // as the cut-off rate. Can be used to keep unnessarily large
    // computer output out of the log.
    // Recommended rates are between 100000 and 1000000 bytes per second
    // but may vary based on machine. Max rate is 20000000.
